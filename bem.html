                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>BEM is a highly useful, powerful, and simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier
                    to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot
                    more strict.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="container container-center">
                <h1>Naming</h1>
                <p>The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the development of a website works with a
                    single codebase and speaks the same language. Using BEM’s proper naming convention will better
                    prepare you for design changes made to your website.</p>

                <h1>Why should we consider BEM?</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-ordered">If we want to make a new style of a component, we can easily see which
                        modifiers and children already exist. We might even realize we don’t need to write any CSS in
                        the first place because there is a pre-existing modifier that does what we need.</li>
                    <li class="list-ordered">If we are reading the markup instead of CSS, we should be able to quickly
                        get an idea of which element depends on another.</li>
                    <li class="list-ordered">Designers and developers can consistently name components for easier
                        communication between team members. In other words, BEM gives everyone on a project a
                        declarative syntax that they can share so that they’re on the same page.</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="container container-center">
                <h1>Block</h1>
                <p>A block represents an object in your website. Think of it as bigger structural chunks of your code.
                    Most common blocks on every website today are header, content, sidebar, footer, and search. Blocks
                    in BEM are always a starting point of chaining your CSS classes on to. </p>
            </div>

        <li>
            <div class="container container-center">
                <h1>Element</h1>
                <p>An element is a component within the block that performs a particular function. It should only make
                    sense in the context of its block.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="container container-center">
                <h1>Modifier</h1>
                <p>A modifier is how we represent the variations of a block. If you’ve ever used Bootstrap, then the
                    best example would be the button sizes. Button sizes are just size variations of the button itself,
                    which makes it the modifier.</p>

                <h1>Advantages and Concerns</h1>
                <h2>Advantages</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-ordered">BEM is excellent for maintaining. How many times have you had to work after
                        someone on a large scaled project and you are just too afraid to change anything without
                        something unknown collapsing? When using BEM, you know the exact purpose of the element and in
                        which block it may appear.</li>
                    <li class="list-ordered">Class names are logical and intuitive, and every member of the team knows
                        what that element does on the website. BEM gives everyone on a project a declarative syntax they
                        can share so they’re on the same page.</li>
                    <li class="list-ordered">BEM eliminates nested CSS selectors. Every single HTML element has its own
                        CSS class, and by its name you know what its purpose is. One selector to rule them all.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Concerns and common mistakes</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li class="list-ordered">Do not go too deep into nesting. The main rule should be not to use more
                        than two levels of parent and child.</li>
                    <li class="list-ordered">Be careful with where you start your block scope. A common mistake here is
                        when a developer is using block, but he is not realising that at the later point of development
                        that same block will have main parent block which will possibly break the rule with nesting.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="container container-center">
                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>To wrap things up I think it’s fair to say that even though BEM won’t solve all our problems it is
                    extraordinarily useful for constructing scalable and maintainable interfaces where everyone on the
                    team should have a clear idea of how things can be improved. This is because a great deal of front
                    end development is not just about the nice tricks that solve one little problem in the short term;
                    we need agreements, promises and binding social contracts between developers so that our codebase
                    can adapt over time.</p>
